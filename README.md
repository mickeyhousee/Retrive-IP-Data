Python script that can be used to extract information about IP addresses. The script uses the IP-API.com API to get information such as the country, city, and ISP for a given IP address.

The script is divided into two functions:

* `prepare_csv()`: This function reads a CSV file of IP addresses and stores the information in a list.
* `store_json_locally()`: This function takes an IP address and an API endpoint and uses the requests library to get the JSON data for that IP address. The JSON data is then stored in a local file.

To use the script, you will need to install the requests and csv libraries. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
pip install requests
pip install csv
```

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the script by typing the following command in your terminal:

```
python main.py
```

The script will then prompt you to select an option from the menu. You can choose to import data from a CSV file, manually enter an IP address, or exit the program.

If you choose to import data from a CSV file, the script will ask you to enter the path to the file. The script will then read the file and store the IP addresses in a list.

If you choose to manually enter an IP address, the script will ask you to enter the IP address. The script will then use the IP-API.com API to get the JSON data for that IP address and store it in a local file.

If you choose to exit the program, the script will stop running.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

* The first line of the code imports the requests and csv libraries.
* The `menu()` function prints a menu of options to the user.
* The `menu_import_csv()` function prompts the user to enter the path to a CSV file of IP addresses. The function then reads the file and stores the IP addresses in a list.
* The `store_json_locally()` function takes an IP address and an API endpoint and uses the requests library to get the JSON data for that IP address. The JSON data is then stored in a local file.
* The `is_valid_ip()` function uses regular expressions to verify that an IP address is valid
